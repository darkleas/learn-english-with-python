# Learn English with Python
This is a program that i code in python to make english learning easier (especilly for me)<br>
So first of all, I want to start with the story of the app. I was reading a book and came across some English words that I had never heard before. So, I was checking them up on Google, but it takes me at least 40 seconds to check one word. Then I realized there had to be a better way to learn their meaning, and I thought that!
I will recite the word through a microphone, and the program will recite it in the Turkish (target language) meaning of the word. I thought it would be awesome!
I know it is easy to make, but I just wanted to share it in case it can help others. Maybe it will give you an idea; who knows?<br>

That is how it looks, but it is not the deal; there is nothing to do with the console. You will recite the word, and the program will recite the meaning of the word in your target language. It is easy to use. _.
I describe some of the codes in main.py in a comment so you can take a look at it and maybe understand it better.
# How do I use it? <br>
As I said, it is very easy. You run the program and say the sentence or word that you want to translate, but add "copy" at the end of the sentence. So, the program will understand that you are trying to translate something.
If you're reading a book and come across the word "X," you can say "X copy" and it will translate it. Without saying copy, it would translate everything that you say, right?
Also, you can check on the console if you pronounce it correctly, and you can spell the word you want to translate.
And I want to say it again: the modules are the backbone of the program!
